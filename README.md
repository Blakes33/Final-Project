# Final-Project

You will need a Python interpreter to run this program (Visual Studio Code with Python extension, IDLE Python, etc...)

IDLE Python can be acquired through this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Visual Studio Code can be acquired through this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

!!*Execution instructions are based on a Visual Studio Code execution, steps may vary if using another interpreter*!!

This program uses Python extensions pyplot and matplotlib to represent a graphical representation of the weighted graph

Execution instructions:
1. Download your interpreter from one of the links above or use one not listed that you feel confident with
2. Download the .py, and .csv files and save them to a location you remember
3. Install the extensions pyplot and matplotlib through the terminal using commands: pip3 install pyplot, pip3 install matplotlib (*Administrator access required*)
4. From within the interpreter click *File> Open File* and navigate to the location where you saved your .py and .csv files
5. Within the interpreter click the run/execute button
